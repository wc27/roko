PACE COMPLEXITY (VERY IMPORTANT)
⭐ Adjacency Matrix → O(n²)

Because it always creates n × n storage, even if no edges exist.

⭐ Adjacency List → O(n + e)

n lists (one per node)

e edges stored only once (or twice if undirected)

This makes adjacency lists much more space-efficient for real-world graphs.

📌 TIME COMPLEXITY (VERY IMPORTANT)
⭐ Operation: Check if edge exists

Matrix → O(1)
Direct access: matrix[u][v]

List → O(k)
Must search the neighbor list of u

⭐ Operation: Add an edge

Matrix → O(1)

List → O(1)

⭐ Operation: Delete an edge

Matrix → O(1)

List → O(k) (search & delete)

⭐ Operation: Traverse neighbors of a node

Matrix → O(n) (must check entire row)

List → O(k) (only check neighbors)
