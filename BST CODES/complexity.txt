6. Time Complexity of BST Operations
Operation	Best / Avg Case	Worst Case
Search	O(log n)	O(n)
Insert	O(log n)	O(n)
Delete	O(log n)	O(n)
Find Min/Max	O(log n)	O(n)
Traversal	O(n)	O(n)
Height	O(n)	O(n)




Space Complexity
Operation	Space Complexity
BST Structure	O(n) (for n nodes)
Recursion Stack (search, insert, delete)	O(h) where h = height
Worst Case	O(n)
Best Case	O(log n)
