Time Complexity (Fractional Knapsack)
Step 1: Sort items by value/weight ratio

Sorting takes:

O(n log n)

Step 2: Loop through sorted items and fill knapsack

This takes:

O(n)

Final Time Complexity:
O(n log n)


(Sorting dominates the complexity)

✅ Space Complexity (Fractional Knapsack)

We only store:

list of items

temporary variables

No dynamic programming table.

So:

O(1)   or O(n) if sorting requires a copy of the array


Most commonly accepted answer:

Space Complexity = O(1)
