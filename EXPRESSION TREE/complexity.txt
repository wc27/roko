Time & Space Complexities
✔ Construction from Prefix/Postfix

Time: O(n) (each character processed once)

Space: O(n) (stack used + nodes stored)

✔ Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)

Time: O(n) — visit every node once

Space:

Recursive: O(h) (height of tree)

Non-recursive: O(n) (worst case)

✔ Evaluate Expression Tree

If operands are numbers:

Time: O(n)

Space: O(h)

✔ Mirroring (swapping left & right)

Time: O(n)

Space: O(h)
