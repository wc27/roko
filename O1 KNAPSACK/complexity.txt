Time Complexity (0/1 Knapsack)

DP table has:

n rows (number of items)

W columns (knapsack capacity)

Thus:

Time Complexity = O(n × W)


This is pseudo-polynomial time, because it depends on both n and W.

✅ Space Complexity (0/1 Knapsack)

The DP table stores n × W values.

So:

Space Complexity = O(n × W)


However, if optimized using a 1D DP array:

Space Complexity reduces to O(W)
